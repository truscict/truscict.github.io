Among existing methods, latent factor models, i.e., learning a specific embedding for each user/item by reconstructing the observed interaction matrix, have shown excellent performances. However, such user-specific and item-specific embeddings are intrinsically transductive, making it difficult for them to deal with new users and new items unseen during training. Besides, the number of model parameters heavily depends on the number of all users and items, restricting their scalability to real-world applications. To solve the above challenges, in this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic and scalable Inductive Embedding Module for collaborative filtering, namely INMO. INMO generates the inductive embeddings for users (items) by characterizing their interactions with some template items (template users), instead of employing an embedding lookup table. Under the theoretical analysis, we further propose an effective indicator for the selection of template users and template items. Our proposed INMO can be attached to existing latent factor models as a pre-module, inheriting the expressiveness of backbone models, while bringing the inductive ability and reducing model parameters. We validate the generality of INMO by attaching it to Matrix Factorization (MF) and LightGCN, which are two representative latent factor models for collaborative filtering. Extensive experiments on three public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of INMO in both transductive and inductive recommendation scenarios.","tags":["Collaborative Filtering"],"title":"INMO: A Model-Agnostic and Scalable Module for Inductive Collaborative Filtering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuchang Tao","Qi Cao","Huawei Shen","Junjie Huang","Yunfan Wu","Xueqi Cheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635724800,"objectID":"c111bd97a2e0bc10d5db63f06a3b3bfc","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/gnia/","publishdate":"2021-11-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/gnia/","section":"publication","summary":"Node injection attack on Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is an emerging and practical attack scenario that the attacker injects malicious nodes rather than modifying original nodes or edges to affect the performance of GNNs. However, existing node injection attacks ignore extremely limited scenarios, namely the injected nodes might be excessive such that they may be perceptible to the target GNN. In this paper, we focus on an extremely limited scenario of single node injection evasion attack, i.e., the attacker is only allowed to inject one single node during the test phase to hurt GNNâ€™s performance. The discreteness of network structure and the coupling effect between network structure and node features bring great challenges to this extremely limited scenario. We first propose an optimization-based method to explore the performance upper bound of single node injection evasion attack. Experimental results show that 100%, 98.60%, and 94.98% nodes on three public datasets are successfully attacked even when only injecting one node with one edge, confirming the feasibility of single node injection evasion attack. However, such an optimization-based method needs to be re-optimized for each attack, which is computationally unbearable. To solve the dilemma, we further propose a Generalizable Node Injection Attack model, namely G-NIA, to improve the attack efficiency while ensuring the attack performance. Experiments are conducted across three well-known GNNs. Our proposed G-NIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and is 500 times faster than the optimization-based method when inferring.","tags":["Adversarial Attack"],"title":"Single Node Injection Attack against Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junjie Huang","Huawei Shen","Qi Cao","Shuchang Tao","Xueqi Cheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1635552000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1635552000,"objectID":"2486e971f258b7d2a1f5d753a552d116","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/sdgnn/","publishdate":"2021-10-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sdgnn/","section":"publication","summary":"Signed networks are such social networks having both positive and negative links. A lot of theories and algorithms have been developed to model such networks (e.g., balance theory). However, previous work mainly focuses on the unipartite signed networks where the nodes have the same type. Signed bipartite networks are different from classical signed networks, which contain two different node sets and signed links between two node sets. Signed bipartite networks can be commonly found in many fields including business, politics, and academics, but have been less studied. In this work, we firstly define the signed relationship of the same set of nodes and provide a new perspective for analyzing signed bipartite networks. Then we do some comprehensive analysis of balance theory from two perspectives on several real-world datasets. Specifically, in the peer review dataset, we find that the ratio of balanced isomorphism in signed bipartite networks increased after rebuttal phases. Guided by these two perspectives, we propose a novel Signed Bipartite Graph Neural Networks (SBGNNs) to learn node embeddings for signed bipartite networks. SBGNNs follow most GNNs message-passing scheme, but we design new message functions, aggregation functions, and update functions for signed bipartite networks. We validate the effectiveness of our model on four real-world datasets on Link Sign Prediction task, which is the main machine learning task for signed networks. Experimental results show that our SBGNN model achieves significant improvement compared with strong baseline methods, including feature-based methods and network embedding methods.","tags":["Signed Networks"],"title":"Signed Bipartite Graph Neural Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junjie Huang","Huawei Shen","Liang Hou","Xueqi Cheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1616803200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1616803200,"objectID":"857d1952a23729b62f3cdd9754012106","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/sbgnn/","publishdate":"2021-03-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sbgnn/","section":"publication","summary":"Network embedding is aimed at mapping nodes in a network into low-dimensional vector representations. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have received widespread attention and lead to state-of-the-art performance in learning node representations. However, most GNNs only work in unsigned networks, where only positive links exist. It is not trivial to transfer these models to signed directed networks, which are widely observed in the real world yet less studied. In this paper, we first review two fundamental sociological theories (i.e., status theory and balance theory) and conduct empirical studies on real-world datasets to analyze the social mechanism in signed directed networks. Guided by related sociological theories, we propose a novel Signed Directed Graph Neural Networks model named SDGNN to learn node embeddings for signed directed networks. The proposed model simultaneously reconstructs link signs, link directions, and signed directed triangles. We validate our model's effectiveness on five real-world datasets, which are commonly used as the benchmark for signed network embedding. Experiments demonstrate the proposed model outperforms existing models, including feature-based methods, network embedding methods, and several GNN methods.","tags":["Signed Networks"],"title":"SDGNN: Learning node representation for signed directed networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shuchang Tao","Qi Cao","Huawei Shen","Liang Hou","Xueqi Cheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1615161600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1615161600,"objectID":"2cfd34788410a084ad80e318d538b8b6","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/advimmune/","publishdate":"2021-03-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/advimmune/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite achieving strong performance in semi-supervised node classification task, graph neural networks (GNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, similar to other deep learning models. Existing researches focus on developing either robust GNN models or attack detection methods against adversarial attacks on graphs. However, little research attention is paid to the potential and practice of immunization to adversarial attacks on graphs. In this paper, we propose and formulate the graph adversarial immunization problem, i.e., vaccinating an affordable fraction of node pairs, connected or unconnected, to improve the certifiable robustness of graph against any admissible adversarial attack. We further propose an effective algorithm, called AdvImmune, which optimizes with meta-gradient in a discrete way to circumvent the computationally expensive combinatorial optimization when solving the adversarial immunization problem. Experiments are conducted on two citation networks and one social network. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed AdvImmune method remarkably improves the ratio of robust nodes by 12%, 42%, 65%, with an affordable immune budget of only 5% edges.","tags":["Adversarial Attack"],"title":"Adversarial Immunization for Certifiable Robustness on Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Junjie Huang","Huawei Shen","Qi Cao","Li Cai","Xueqi Cheng"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1609977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609977600,"objectID":"3e13d7e75d58847ca57c794e092b7d21","permalink":"https://example.com/publication/waterdrop/","publishdate":"2021-01-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/waterdrop/","section":"publication","summary":"While online medical crowdfunding achieved tremendous success, quantitative study about whether and how medical crowdfunding helps people remains little explored. In this paper, we empirically study how online medical crowdfunding helps people using more than 27, 000 fundraising cases in Waterdrop Fundraising, one of the most popular online medical crowdfunding platforms in China. We find that the amount of money obtained by fundraisers is broadly distributed, i.e., a majority of lowly donated cases coexist with a handful of very successful cases. We further investigate the factors that potentially correlate with the success of medical fundraising cases. Profile information of fundraising cases, e.g., geographic information of fundraisers, affects the donated amounts, since detailed description may increase the credibility of a fundraising case. One prominent finding lies in the effect of social network on the success of fundraising cases, the spread of fundraising information along social network is a key factor of fundraising success, and the social capital of fundraisers play an important role in fundraising. Finally, we conduct prediction of donations using machine learning models, verifying the effect of potential factors to the success of medical crowdfunding. Altogether, this work presents a data-driven view of medical fundraising on the web and opens a door to understanding medical crowdfunding.","tags":["Crowdfunding"],"title":"How Medical Crowdfunding Helps People?
